Introduction to the Data Set
============================

This dataset is a list of holidays around the world. Each row has a record of the country, the holiday name, the date, which day of the week does it fall, and whether it is declared as national holiday. It is possible that different countries can share the same holiday on the same date, but with different names. It is also possible for countries to share holidays with the same name, but on different dates. The critical evaluation depends on the person's viewpoint. In this case, we assume a marketing officer working for AirBnB who focuses South East Asia market. Obviously, holiday dates would be important to him/her rather than the holiday names when he/she plans any marketing strategy to encourage people to use AirBnB during their holidays.


The Warm-ups
============

For warm-ups, it would be interesting to know which countries has the most holidays. "CHECKPOINT 1" shows that India, Malaysia, Nepal, and Cambodia are the top Asian countries with the most holidays in a year. Another interesting thing to look is calculating the most common holidays celebrated by most countries. "CHECKPOINT 2" shows the top 10 common holidays, however the tricky part was getting the holiday names associate to the holiday date. For example, 1st January is commonly known as "New Year's Day", but is also called "New Year Bank Holiday" in a few countries. "CHECKPOINT 2" python code showed that we search all names assocaited to that date, but we take the name from the last row for convenience, also because we're not really interested in knowing all the names for that date. Based on DJ Patil idea of data-story telling:

What are the key takeaways?
- India, Malaysia, Nepal, Cambodia are probably the most relaxed Asian countries (or laziest)

What should I do with it?
- For a start, it will be good to start creating marketing strategies targeting the above 4 countries, but further data wrangling is required

How should I feel about the data?
- Feel pretty good


The Main Story
==============

Now that we know those four countries have the most number of holidays in a year, it is great opportunity the AirBnB marketing to dive deeper to those countries and dig out more interesting insights. For a start, we will pick Malaysia and learn more about Malaysian holiday trends. "CHECKPOINT 3" shows all rows of holidays in Malaysia group by month. We add an extra column 'month' for easy grouping, then the data is plot as a line graph. From the graph output, you can tell that Malaysia holidays peak period on May and October, and there is at least 1 holiday in every month. These are perfect times for Malaysians to travel, so it will be good idea for strategic marketing planning to target Malaysian audience to travel abroad.

By comparing this chart with 'CHECKPOINT 4' which has all holiday dates (no duplicates) group by month, you notice that May is also the month that has the most holidays celebrated in various countries. It is definitely the perfect season to promote travelling and celebrate holidays and culture in different countries, the perfect opportunity for AirBnB to promote their branding - staying and experiencing culture and 'being part of a big family'. The marketing person in South East Asia can tap this opportunity to promote May as a travelling season to Malaysians and use AirBnB services.

What are the key takeaways?
- May and October are best months for Malaysians to travel, at the same time May has the most holidays celebrated across the globe.

What should I do with it?
- Look into various marketing techniques to get Malaysians to travel abroad and use AirBnB services

How should I feel about the data?
- Get pumped and start brainstorming before May arrives.
